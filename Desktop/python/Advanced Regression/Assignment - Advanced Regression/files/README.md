## General Information
This assignment contains two parts. Part-I is a programming assignment (to be submitted in a Jupyter Notebook), and Part-II includes subjective questions (to be submitted in a PDF file). 

### Assignment Part-I
A US-based housing company called Surprise Housing plans to expand into the Australian market. The company specializes in using data analytics to identify undervalued houses, purchase them at a lower price, and then sell them at a higher price. To support their entry into the Australian market, Surprise Housing has collected a dataset of house sales in Australia, which is provided in a CSV file.

The company is now seeking to identify prospective properties to invest in and wants to build a regression model using regularization techniques. This model will help predict the actual value of the prospective properties and assist in deciding whether to invest in them.

The company has two main objectives:

Identify the significant variables that can predict the price of a house: By analyzing the dataset, we can determine which variables have a strong influence on the house prices in Australia.


Assess how well these variables describe the price of a house: The company wants to understand the extent to which these significant variables can accurately describe and predict house prices.

Additionally, the optimal values of lambda for ridge and lasso regression need to be determined. Lambda is a regularization parameter that helps prevent overfitting in the model by adding a penalty term to the regression equation.

By addressing these objectives and finding the optimal lambda values, Surprise Housing can make informed decisions about which properties to invest in based on their predicted values and the significance of the variables influencing those values.


#### Business Goal 

You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

### Assignment Part-II
The following questions are the second part of the graded assignment. Please submit the answers in one PDF file. For writing normal text, please use MS Word (or similar software that can convert documents to PDF). For equations and figures, you can write/draw them on a blank sheet of paper using a pen, click images and upload them in the same Word document.

The final submission will be in the form of one PDF file. A sample PDF to illustrate the submission format is provided below.

Please limit your answers to less than 500 words per question.
 

Question 1

What is the optimal value of alpha for ridge and lasso regression? What will be the changes in the model if you choose double the value of alpha for both ridge and lasso? What will be the most important predictor variables after the change is implemented?


Question 2

You have determined the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression during the assignment. Now, which one will you choose to apply and why?


Question 3

After building the model, you realised that the five most important predictor variables in the lasso model are not available in the incoming data. You will now have to create another model excluding the five most important predictor variables. Which are the five most important predictor variables now?


Question 4

How can you make sure that a model is robust and generalisable? What are the implications of the same for the accuracy of the model and why?
